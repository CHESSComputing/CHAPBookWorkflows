description: Standalone workflow for processing Energy Dispersive Diffraction (EDD) data. First, calibrate the 2-theta angle for each MCA element using a frame of data taken on a ceria sample. Then measure the length of the diffraction volume using a steel foil raster scan. Finally, compute the microstrain at each point on a sample map.
